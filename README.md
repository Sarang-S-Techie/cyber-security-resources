Hello folks, when I was a student, I always struggled to find some quality resources from where I can learn cyber security. I will be sharing all the resources that you will be requring in order to learn cyber security from basics, be it books, blogs, video tutorials and much more. Let us begin!


A quick walkaround on the basics of Cyber Security  - 

- Cybersecurity: an overview

  Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems from cyberthreats such as hardware, software, and data. Individuals and businesses     utilise the method to prevent illegal access to data centres and other digital systems. With an increasing number of users, devices, and programmes in the modern   organisation, as well as an increased deluge of data, most of it is sensitive or secret, the relevance of cybersecurity is growing. The increasing volume   and skill of cyber attackers and attack strategies exacerbates the problem.

- Computer forensics

  Computer forensics is the use of investigative techniques to locate and save evidence from a computer device. Computer forensics is frequently utilised     to unearth evidence that could be used in court. Computer forensics also includes topics other than investigations. Professionals in this industry are     occasionally relied upon to recover lost data from damaged discs, wrecked servers, or reformatted operating systems.
  
- Cyberdefense

  Cyber defenseÂ used to be a problem just for huge corporations and government agencies, not for the common person. However, a new species of hacker has     emerged, one that targets an individual's smartphone, credit card payments, and personal data maintained by small to medium-sized businesses. Cyber         defence is all about providing an entity with the power to thwart cyber attacks in real time via cyber security. It encompasses all processes and           activities designed to protect a network, its data, and nodes from illegal access or manipulation.
